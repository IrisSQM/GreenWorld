<p>From the threads of thoughts, </p>

<h3>Snippets 2024</h3>
<h4>To be added. 待更新...</h4>
<h3>Snippets 2023</h3>
<h4>《大量废弃社会》</h4>
<ol>
<li>所以说真正决定“新闻价值”的，是特定时代、国家及人民看待问题的态度，对此做出筛选的人则是编辑和记者。(pp. 4)</li>
<li>“新闻”一词的字面意义就是“新的见闻”。最新发生的事、不常出现的事、发生变化的事容易写成报道，然而那些即使存在问题，却为社会所默许，变化缓慢，难以进入到大众视线当中的事，却总是难以成文。记者的“基本使命”-监督权力并与之斗争。(pp. 5)</li>
<li>我认为发达国家的民众对媒体越来越不信任的原因不仅在于贫富差距扩大化与网络舆论极端化，还有对“与自身息息相关的问题”被媒体边缘化而感到的不满。(pp. 6)</li>
<li>“商品陈旧化”理论始终是商业模式的核心 (pp. 10)</li>
<li>在团队分工合作的情况下，工人会经手不同种类服装的整个制作过程，因此在几年后，工人的技术水平会得到提高，工资也会上涨。但在孟加拉国那样的国家里，制作工序和流程被细分化，即使刚刚进厂的工人也能迅速投入工作。甚至有的人进了工厂，整整一年都在安装服装右侧的纽扣。这样的工作无论干上多久，工人的技术水平也不会提升，工资也不会上涨。至于企业方面，由于成本降低，也做好了商品滞销的心理准备，只要整体能盈利就行。(pp. 17)</li>
<li>才能变现 (pp. 19)</li>
<li>“消费者的成熟””不囿于个人欲望，与社会及自然环境共生意识的觉醒“ (pp. 23)</li>
<li>“惜物”精神 (pp. 59)</li>
<li>服装行业解决方案：（1）公开价格。案例：10YC，GUSTIN，Everlane，Factelier，People Tree（2）有效利用技术。案例：KASHIYAMA the Smart Tailor</li>
<li>食品行业井出女士的观点：（1）每人每天都浪费了一碗米饭（2）错失销售机会（3）“便利店记账法”与“销售有效期”（4）奇特的“三分之一”法则（5）将“减少垃圾产生”放在首位（6）借助消费者的力量改变食品行业。案例：多利安面包店、Gragger、食品银行与食品募捐、“凉/烤豆腐指数”、需求预测指数、荻野餐厅、“3010”运动、“狗狗袋”</li>
<li>如果公司遵循“销量全靠降价”这一方针，顾客会越来越难以感受到商品的真正价值，服装的生产者们也会受到伤害，这对他们双方都是一种辜负。(pp. 70)</li>
<li>“让生产者与顾客双方都满意”的宗旨；精心生产的服装能够改变人们的日常生活；注重保持游戏心态和愉快的心情 (pp. 72)</li>
<li>它既涉及劳动问题与整个服务业的症结，更是一种诞生于新型商业活动之中的“人为创造的习俗” (pp. 96)</li>
<li>"三方得利"，近江商人，卖家、买家、社会。并不鼓励一味扩张，而是“恰到好处”，并将有益的事物与他人分享。(pp. 97)</li>
<li>“在琳琅满目的商品中挑选”已经成为了顾客所习以为常的行为 (pp. 97)</li>
<li>所谓的经典，就是抓住事物本质，在任何时代都不会过时的东西，因此无需进行改变。(pp. 119)</li>
<li>第一代人：从欧洲引进面包和葡萄酒并尝试制作；第二代人：在日本用欧洲的材料制作出正宗地道的产品；第三代人：用日本的原料，结合日本的气候与水土，制作出符合日本人口味的产品 （pp. 120)</li>
<li>资源共享型社会 (pp. 153)</li>
<li>道德时尚 (pp. 156)</li>
<li>始终在价格、流行度或便利性这些可变换的价值上进行竞争，只会让人疲惫不堪。(pp. 167)</li>
<li>自然而然地与生产者共情 （pp. 174)</li>
</ol>
<h4>Lean In by Sheryl Sandberg《向前一步》</h4>
<ol>
<li>Even worse, the messages sent to girls can move beyond encouraging superficial traits and veer into explicitly discouraging leadership. (pp. 21)</li>
<li>The gender stereotypes introduced in childhood are reinforced throughout our lives and become self-fulfilling prophecies. (pp. 23)</li>
<li>Women are not thinking about 'having it all,' they are worried about losing it all - their jobs, their children's health, their families' financial stability.</li>
<li>Framing the issue as work-life balance - as if the two were diametrically opposed - practically ensures work will lose out. (pp. 25)</li>
<li>Fear is the root of so many of the barriers that women face. Fear of not being liked. Fear of making the wrong choice. Fear of drawing negative attention. Fear of overreaching. Fear of being judged. Fear of failure. And the holy trinity of fear: the fear of being a bad mother/wife/daughter. (pp. 26)</li>
<li>undistort the distortion (pp. 35)</li>
<li>fake it till you feel it (pp. 36)</li>
<li>Opportunities are not well defined but, instead, come from someone jumping in to do something. That something then become his job.</li>
<li>It is hard to visualize someone as a leader if she is always waiting to be told what to do. (pp. 37)</li>
<li>There is no perfect fit when you're looking for the next big thing to do. You have to take opportunities and make an opportunity fit for you. (pp. 38)</li>
<li>For women, "self-doubt becomes a form of self-defense." We put ourselves done before others. (pp. 44)</li>
<li>Owning one's success is key to achieving more success. (pp. 47)</li>
<li>"gender discount" problem (pp. 48)</li>
<li>The goal of a successful negotiation is to achieve our objectives and continue to have people like us. (pp. 50)</li>
<li>pronouns matter, justify their requests, relentlessly pleasant (pp. 51)</li>
<li>When you want to change things, you can't please everyone. If you do please everyone, you aren't making enough progress. (pp. 55)</li>
<li>a long-term dream and an eighteen month plan (pp. 58)</li>
<li>Employees who concentrate on results and impact are the most valuable. Set more personal goals for learning new skills in the next eighteen months. (pp. 63)</li>
<li>Letting the other side make the first offer is often crucial to achieving favorable terms. (pp. 64)</li>
<li>In business, being risk averse can result in stagnation. Seeking out diverse experience is useful preparation for leadership. (pp. 66)</li>
<li>The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any. (pp. 68)</li>
<li>The men were focusing on how to manage a business and the women focusing on how to manage a career. (pp. 71)</li>
<li>Excel and you will get a mentor. (pp. 73)</li>
<li>Asking for input is not a sign of weakness but often the first step to finding a path forward. (pp. 76)</li>
<li>All advice is autobiographical. (pp. 80)</li>
<li>As we learn to speak appropriately, we lose something in authenticity. (pp. 82)</li>
<li>not brutally honest but delicately honest (pp. 83)</li>
<li>Great leadership is "conscious" leadership - Fred Kofman</li>
<li>When communicating hard truths, less is often more, (pp. 85)</li>
<li>Feedback, like truth, is not absolute. Feedback is an opinion, grounded in observations and experiences, which allows us to know what impression we make on others. (pp. 88)</li>
<li>Being open to hearing the truth means taking responsibility for mistakes. (pp. 89-90)</li>
<li>Motivation comes from working on things we care about. It also comes from working with people we care about. (pp. 94)</li>
<li>True leadership stems from individuality that is honestly and sometimes imperfectly expressed. Strive for authenticity over perfection. (pp. 97)</li>
<li>But when it comes to integrating career and family, planning too far in advance can close doors rather than open them. (pp. 99)</li>
<li>Women wind up leaving the workforce precisely because of things they did to stay in the workforce. (pp. 100)</li>
<li>Anyone lucky enough to have options should keep them open. (pp. 110)</li>
<li>It's not about biology, but about consciousness. (pp. 115)</li>
<li>Trying to do it all and expecting that it all can be done exactly right is a recipe for disappointment. (pp. 131)</li>
<li>Be a perfectionist in only the things that mattered. (pp. 131)</li>
<li>Done is better than perfect. (pp. 133)</li>
<li>Setting obtainable goals is key to happiness. Instead of perfection, we should aim for sustainable and fulfilling. Success is making the best choices we can... and accepting them. The secret is there is no secret-just doing the best you can with what you've got. (pp. 148)</li>
<li>Whoever has power takes over the noun-and the norm-while the less powerful get an adjective. (pp. 149)</li>
<li>No one wants her achievements modified. (pp. 149)</li>
<li>Leadership is about making others better as a result of your presence and making sure that impact lasts in your absence. Social gains are never handed out. They must be seized. (pp. 167)</li>
<li>Equal opportunity is not equal unless everyone receives the encouragement that makes seizing those opportunities possible. (pp. 170)</li>
<li>To feel comfortable with our choices and to feel validated by those around us. (pp. 178)</li>
<li>Our job is not to make young women grateful. It is to make them ungrateful so they keep going. (pp. 182)</li>

<h4>Haroun and the Sea of Stories《哈乐与故事海》</h4>
<ol>
<li>A blind man's blindness must feel twice as wretched then. - Rashid (pp. 22)</li>
<li>Need's a slippery snake. Need's a funny fish: It makes people untruthful. - Butt (pp. 24)</li>
<li>No story comes from nowhere; new stories are born from old. - Iff (pp. 74)</li>
<li>You know how people are, new things, always new. The old tales, nobody cares. - Iff (pp. 74)</li>
<li>Dark, my sirs, has its fascinations: mystery, strangeness, romance ... - Iff (pp. 91)</li>
<li>Don't you know girls have to fool people everyday of their lives if they want to get anywhere? - Blabbermouth (pp. 95)</li>
<li>You keep a lot of different tales in the air, and juggle them up and down, and if you're good you don't drop any. So maybe juggling is a kind of storytelling, too. - Haroun (pp. 97)</li>
<li>That's the trouble with you sad city types: you think a place has to be miserable and dull as ditchwater before you believe it's real. - Blabbermouth (pp. 103)</li>
<li>And is not the Power of Speech the greatest Power of all? Then surely it must be exercised to the full. - Butt the Hoopoe (pp. 107)</li>
<li>It is all for Love, which is a wonderful and dashing matter. But which can also be a very foolish thing. - Mali (pp. 108)</li>
<li>Silence had its own grace and beauty (just as speech could be graceless and ugly); and that Action could be as noble as words; and that creatures of darkness could be as lovely as the children of the light. - Haroun (pp. 113)</li>
<li>So peace with the Chupwalas means Peace with their Shadows, too. - Mudra (pp. 121)</li>
<li>It is a sad time when a Chupwala cannot even trust his own shadow. - Mudra (pp. 122)</li>
<li>We lost touch with our beginnings, with our roots, our wellspring, our source. - Iff (pp. 134)</li>
<li>The worst things of all can look so normal and, well, dull. - Haroun (pp. 141)</li>
<li>War makes people crude. (pp. 174)</li>
<li>They had talked through everything so fully, fought hard, remained united, supported each other when required to do so, and in general looked like a force with a common purpose. All those arguments and debates, all that openness, had created powerful bonds of fellowship between them. / Their vows of silence and their habits of secrecy had made them suspicious and distrustful of one another. (pp. 175)</li>
<li>Happy endings are much rarer in stories, and also in life, than most people think. You could almost say they are the exceptions, not the rule. - Walrus (pp. 191)</li>
<li>Happy endings must come at the end of something. If they happen in the middle of a story, or an adventure, or the like, all they do is cheer things up for a while. - Walrus (pp. 192)</li>
<li>Money isn't everything; no money is nothing at all. - Rashid &amp; Mail Coach (pp. 197)</li>
</ol>
<h4>What It Takes by Stephen A. Schwarzman《苏世民：我的经验与教训》</h4>
<ol>
<li>Teaching, I came to believe, is about more than sharing knowledge. You have to remove the obstacles in people's way.</li>
<li>It’s just as hard to achieve big goals as it is small ones. The only difference is that bigger goals have much more significant consequences.</li>
<li>It’s at these inflection points that the most important lessons in business and life are learned.</li>
<li>The best executives are made, not born. They absorb information, study their own experiences, learn from their mistakes, and evolve.</li>
<li>But what I lacked in basic economics, I made up for with my ability to see patterns and develop new solutions and paradigms, and with the sheer will to turn my ideas into reality.</li>
<li>applying resources to change paradigms in a way that will have an impact on lives, not just the bottom line.</li>
<li>I believe that education is a discipline. The object of this discipline is to learn how to think. Once we have mastered this, we can use it to learn a vocation, appreciate art, or read a book. Education simply enables us to appreciate the ever-changing drama fashioned of God’s own hand, life itself. Education continues when we leave the classroom. Our associations with friends, our participation in clubs all increase our store of knowledge. In fact, we never stop learning until we die. My fellow officers and I just hope that you will become aware of the purpose of education and follow its basic tenets, questioning and thinking, for the rest of your life.</li>
<li>At some point in life, we have to figure out who we are, he said. The sooner we do it the better, so we can pursue the opportunities that are right for us, not some false dream created by others.</li>
<li>People often think theirs is the only reality, but there are as many realities as there are individuals. The more you see of them, the more likely you are to make sense of them.</li>
<li>For a business to succeed, each part has to work on its own and with all the other parts.</li>
<li>As long as you can be honest and rational and are able to explain yourself, there is no reason to feel uncomfortable.</li>
<li>ability to deal with uncertainty, self-confidence, intellectual curiosity, courtesy, an ability to adjust to new situations, emotional stability under pressure, a zero-defect mentality, an unwavering commitment to behaving with integrity and striving for excellence in all we choose to do.</li>
<li>Investors are always looking for great investments. The easier you make it for them, the better for everyone.</li>
<li>People who succeed in finance must start with repetitive practice before they can ever hope to achieve mastery.</li>
<li>There are people who come to finance from other professions, from law or the media perhaps, but the best I’ve ever worked with grew up in it. They learned by doing the fundamental analysis.</li>
<li>The most important asset in business is information.</li>
<li>The more you know, the more perspectives you have and the more connections you can make, which allow you to anticipate issues.</li>
<li>Deals ultimately come down to a few key points that matter most to each side. If you can clear everything else away and focus on these points, you will be an effective negotiator.</li>
<li>Listening closely and watching the way people talk puts me much closer to answering the question I’m always asking myself, which is: How can I help? If I can help someone and become a friend to their situation, everything else follows.</li>
<li>There is nothing more interesting to people than their own problems. If you can find out what they are and come up with solutions, they will want to talk to you no matter their rank or status.</li>
<li>Money is a poor cure for a bad situation.</li>
<li>When you disagree, it’s important to get your opinions on record so you aren’t blamed later when things go wrong.</li>
<li>People who are 10s sense problems, design solutions, and take the business in new directions without being told to do so.</li>
<li>sense of working for a single, coherent entity</li>
<li>Success is about taking advantage of those rare moments of opportunity that you can’t predict but come to you provided you’re alert and open to major changes.</li>
<li>People in a tough spot will often focus on their own problems when the answer may lie in fixing someone else’s.</li>
<li>To invest only when values have recovered at least 10 percent from their lows.</li>
<li>While most investors say they are interested in making money, they are actually interested in psychological comfort. They would rather be part of the herd, even when the herd is losing money, than make the hard decisions that yield the greatest rewards.</li>
<li>Finance is an industry that encourages self-delusion.</li>
<li>The first was focus. The second way to maximize your chances of achieving excellence was to ask for help when needed.</li>
<li>In any conversation with someone you don’t know, you should always be patient and keep asking questions until you find a place of common ground.</li>
<li>Hearing the nuance in someone’s voice or seeing that person’s body language told me as much as anything he or she said.</li>
<li>We enter these situations with financing, a strategy to transform the business, and expert operating professionals, and we invest the time needed to turn them around.</li>
<li>They feel threatened by bad news and dread the uncertainty of change and the hard work it demands. This tendency makes them passive and rigid at the very moment they should be most active and flexible.</li>
<li>At its best, worrying is playful, engaging work that requires that you never switch off.</li>
<li>“But there are times when you just have to stand up and write a check. You have to show customers that you own this, because if you don’t, they’re not going to trust you ever again.”</li>
<li>Success breeds arrogance and complacency, he said. You only learn from your mistakes and when the worst happens.</li>
<li>“When we buy companies and real estate, it’s like planting crops. You put seeds in the ground, you water, and the seeds start growing, but you can’t see the crop yet. Then they grow very high, and it will be a great crop, and you will be very, very happy.”</li>
<li>When people are being stopped, for no good reason, from buying what they need, the system has to adjust.</li>
<li>buying in the right way at the right time in the cycle</li>
<li>Three tests for a new line of business: It must have the potential to be hugely rewarding for investors. It must add to Blackstone’s intellectual capital. And it must have a 10 in charge of it.</li>
<li>That experience taught me that the prestige of that first job didn’t matter nearly as much as the opportunities I lost to develop my skills.</li>
<li>I am now quite certain that China is no longer an elective course for future generations; rather, it is core curriculum, and Schwarzman Scholars is the best version of that curriculum we could devise.</li>
<li>What America viewed as a request for China to modernize its economy and bring it in line with the standards required by international law, China viewed as a demand to become more like America.</li>
<li>finding fantastic people and giving them the chance to be the best at what they do</li>
<li>“bilinguals of the future,” fluent in both AI and their own academic discipline, scientific or not.</li>
<li>But as science and technology have accelerated, introducing the concept of machines which are designed to replicate human intelligence, there are many new moral, philosophical, and ethical questions to consider regarding what it means to be human and what values we want our technology to reflect.</li>
<li>In a world that is changing so quickly, it’s quite possible this type of cross-institutional, global collaboration is the only way to ensure a safe and prosperous future for us all.</li>
<li>I have long believed that education is the passport to a better life.</li>
<li>We all have a duty to not only preserve the knowledge that is handed to us but also develop it in a way that improves its relevance and impact for future generations.</li>
<li>Regardless of how you begin your careers, it is important to realize that your life will not necessarily move in a straight line.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Nudge by Richard H. Thaler and Cass R. Sunstein《助推》</h4>
<ol>
<li>Libertarian Paternalism (pp.6)</li>
<li>The false assumption is that almost all people, almost all the time, make choices that are in their best interest or at the very least are better than the choices that would be made by someone else. (pp.13)</li>
<li>The first misconception is that it is possible to avoid influencing people’s choices. (pp.14)</li>
<li>The second misconception is that paternalism always involves coercion. (pp.15)</li>
<li>“anchoring and adjustment” – the bias occurs because the adjustments are typically insufficient. (pp.27)</li>
<li>Second marriage is the triumph of hope over experience. (pp.34)</li>
<li>Loss aversion helps produce inertia, meaning a strong desire to stick with your current holdings. (pp.35)</li>
<li>One of the causes of status quo bias is a lack of attention. (pp.37)</li>
<li>The combination of loss aversion and mindless choosing is one reason why if an option is designated as the default, it will usually (but not always!) attract a large market share. (pp.38)</li>
<li>Automatic system (fast and intuitive) vs. Reflective system (slow and reflective) (pp.41)</li>
<li>One reason why teenagers are such risky drivers is that their Automatic Systems have not had much practice, and using the Reflective System is much slower. (pp.44)</li>
<li>Hot-cold empathy gap – underestimate the strength of the effect (pp.52)</li>
<li>Two semiautonomous selves: a farsighted “Planner” and a myopic “Doer” (pp.52)</li>
<li>Econs are pretty unsociable creatures. They communicate with others only if they can gain something from the encounter, they care about their reputations (because a good reputation is valuable), and they will learn from others if actual information can be obtained, but Econs are not followers of fashion. Their hemlines do not go up and down except for practical reasons, they do not wear ties, and if they did they would not grow narrower and wider simply as a matter of style. (pp.64)</li>
<li>The first involves the information that seems to be conveyed by other people’s answers; the second involves peer pressure and the desire not to face the disapproval of the group. (pp.68-69)</li>

<li>The golden rule of libertarian paternalism: offer nudges that are most likely to help and least likely to inflict harm. (pp.91)</li>
<li>People are most likely to need nudges when decisions require scarce attention, when decisions are difficult, when people do not get prompt feedback, and when they have trouble translating aspects of the situation into terms that they can easily understand. (pp.91)</li>
<li>To all their virtues, markets often give companies a strong incentive to cater to (and profit from) our frailties, rather than to try to eradicate them or to minimize their effects. (pp.92)</li>
<li>The situation is not structured to provide good feedback. For example, we usually get feedback only on the options we select, not the ones we reject. Unless people go out of their way to experiment, they may never learn about alternatives to the familiar ones. (pp.98)</li>

<h4>Scarcity by Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir《稀缺》</h4>
<ol>
<li>Scarcity captures the mind (pp.7)</li>
<li>Subjective expansion of time (pp.9)</li>
<li>The feeling of scarcity is distinct from its physical reality. (pp.11)</li>
<li>When scarcity captures the mind, we become more attentive and efficient. (pp.13)</li>
<li>Scarcity of all varieties also leads to a shortage of bandwidth. (pp.13)</li>
<li>Scarcity creates its own trap. (pp.14)</li>
<li>Scarcity captures our attention, and this provides a narrow benefit: we do a better job of managing pressing needs. But more broadly, it costs us: we neglect other concerns, and we become less effective in the rest of life. (pp.15)</li>
<li>Scarcity of any kind, not just time, should yield a focus dividend. (pp.24)</li>
<li>Focusing on one thing means neglecting other things. (pp.29)</li>
<li>The power of focus is also the power to shut things out. (pp.29)</li>
<li>Tunnel: to focus single-mindedly on managing the scarcity at hand. (pp.29)</li>
<li>To photograph is to frame, and to frame is to exclude. -Susan Sontag (pp.29)</li>
<li>A seat belt that never crosses your mind cannot be buckled. (pp.29)</li>
<li>Focusing on one thing inhibits competing concepts. (pp.31)</li>
<li>Goal inhibition is the mechanism underlying tunneling. (pp.31)</li>
<li>Because the focus on scarcity is involuntary, and because it captures our attention, it impedes our ability to focus on other things. (pp.41)</li>
<li>By constantly drawing us back into the tunnel, scarcity taxes our bandwidth and, as a result, inhibits our most fundamental capacities. (pp.42)</li>
<li>Proactive interference (pp.46)</li>
<li>Scarcity directly reduces bandwidth (pp.47)</li>
<li>Fluid intelligence, executive control (pp.47)</li>
<li>Raven’s Progressive Matrices test (pp.48)</li>
<li>Once you realize that willpower is just a matter of learning how to control your attention and thoughts, you can really begin to increase it. (pp.53)</li>
<li>Stroop task (pp.58)</li>
<li>Poverty itself taxes the mind. Poverty reduces fluid intelligence and executive control. (pp.60)</li>
<li>The problem is not the person but the context of scarcity. (pp.65)</li>
<li>Scarcity forces trade-off thinking. (pp.72)</li>
<li>Slack is what allows us to feel there is no trade-off. (pp.73)</li>
<li>Slack frees us from making trade-offs. (pp.73)</li>
<li>Slack – in money, time, or calories – allows you the luxury of not choosing. (pp.80)</li>
<li>Contrary to Milton Friedman’s ideal of “free to choose,” slack leaves us free not to choose. (pp.80)</li>
<li>It means mistakes do not entail real sacrifice. (pp.81)</li>
<li>Planning fallacy: we are all much too optimistic with our future plans. (pp.81)</li>
<li>The temptation tax is regressive; it is levied more heavily on those who have less. (pp.82)</li>
<li>Small budgets make for bulky items and for complex packing; large budgets make for granular items and for easier packing. (pp.85)</li>
<li>The effect of scarcity may be more than psychological; it can be a mathematical fact. (pp.85)</li>
<li>Scarcity: a subjective sense of having more needs than resources. (pp.86)</li>
<li>Slack is not just inefficiency; it is a mental luxury. (pp.86)</li>
<li>It affords us the luxury of packing poorly, the luxury of not having to think, as well as the luxury of not minding mistakes. (pp.86)</li>
<li>While relative perception is inherently part of how the mind processes information, experience and expertise allow us to transcend it. (pp.92)</li>
<li>The poor are expert in the value of a dollar. (pp.94)</li>
<li>Slack, and the absence of trade-offs, means we have no intuitive, easy way of valuing things. (pp.96)</li>
<li>When making a purchase, the frugal consider whether the price is “good.” The poor, in contrast, must ask themselves what they must give up to afford that price. (pp.98)</li>
<li>But economics is meant to follow the logic of scarcity. It is fitting then that its predictions are truer for those who actually have the scarcity mindset. (pp.104)</li>
<li>Borrowing goes hand in hand with scarcity. (pp.108)</li>
<li>The reason the poor borrow is poverty itself. (pp.115)</li>
<li>Scarcity, and tunneling in particular, leads you to put off important but not urgent things – cleaning your office, getting a colonoscopy, writing a will – that are easy to neglect. (pp.117)</li>
<li>But what is remarkable in this account is that myopia is not a personal failure. Tunneling is not a personal trait. (pp.120)</li>
<li>Tunnels limit everyone’s vision. (pp.121)</li>
<li>Scarcity trap: a situation where a person’s behavior contributes to her scarcity. (pp.125)</li>
<li>Juggling: the constant move from one pressing task to the next. (pp.128)</li>
<li>Juggling is not about being harried in time; it is about having a lot on one’s mind. (pp.129)</li>
<li>These two features – being one step behind and juggling – define the scarcity trap. (pp.129)</li>
<li>It is as important to have enough slack (or some other mechanism) for handling the big shocks that may come one’s way at any moment. (pp.137)</li>
<li>One cannot take a vacation from poverty. (pp.148)</li>
<li>A lack of discretion makes for a particularly extreme form of scarcity. (pp.149)</li>
<li>By poverty, we mean cases of economic scarcity where changing what you want, or think you need, is simply not viable. (pp.149)</li>
<li>For a limit to affect behavior it must enter the tunnel. (pp.172)</li>
<li>Economizing on bandwidth can yield high returns. (pp.175)</li>
<li>A greater focus on the creation of dependable jobs and stable incomes for the poor across the world could be psychologically transformative. (pp.178)</li>
<li>A solution would be to create the equivalent of unemployment insurance against such fluctuations in work hours, which to the poor can be even more pernicious than job loss. (pp.178)</li>
<li>And when you are not tightly packed, there’s a feeling that perhaps you are not doing enough. (pp.187)</li>
<li>When you face scarcity, slack is a necessity. (pp.187)</li>
<li>Firefighting trap: time is spent on fighting the immediate fire, with new fires constantly popping up because nothing is being done to prevent them. (pp.192)</li>
<li>The restaurant business is really about seating scarcity. (pp.200)</li>
<li>“Scarcity-proof” our environment (pp.206)</li>
<li>When there’s neglect, it is often more effective to alter the outcome it leads to rather than fight it. (pp.209)</li>
<li>To make matters worse, so many bad behaviors need be done just once to cause the pain. (pp.212)</li>
<li>This suggests a recipe: whenever possible, convert vigilant behaviors into one-time actions. (pp.212)</li>
<li>One insight of the psychology of scarcity is the need to prepare for tunneling and to insulate against neglect: navigate so that bad choices are harder to make in a single moment of tunneling, and arrange it so that good behaviors require little vigilance yet are occasionally reevaluated. (pp.213)</li>
<li>Put simply, the truth about all those good decisions you plan to make sometime in the future, when things are easiest, is that you probably won’t make them once that future rolls around and things are tough again. (pp.215)</li>
<li>Exploiting bandwidth might include not only timing tasks and events but also setting the best order. (pp.220)</li>
<li>As our island of knowledge grows, so does the shore of our ignorance. – John A. Wheeler</li>
<li>Yet we know next to nothing about the cognitive side of the economy. (pp.229)</li>
<li>While scarcity plays a starring role in many important problems, abundance sets the stage for it. (pp.234)</li>

<li>Speak less than you know; have more than you show. 怀璧慎显，博识谨言。</li>
<li>When I was young and free and my imagination had no limits, I dreamed of changing the world. As I grew older and wiser, I discovered the world would not change, so I shortened my sights somewhat and decided to change only my country. But it, too, seemed immovable. As I grew into my twilight years, in one last desperate attempt, I settled for changing only my family, those close to me, but alas, they would have none of it. And now, as I lie on my deathbed, I suddenly realize: If I had only changed myself first, then by example, I would have changed my family. From their inspiration and encouragement, I would then have been able to better my country and who knows, I may have even changed the world. - Westminster Abbey</li>
