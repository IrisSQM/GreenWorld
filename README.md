* What's up now   

I am currently working on an assignment about image to image translation using Pix2Pix. It translates aerial images to maps.   
The evaluation metric is SSIM.   

Model 4 has achieved SSIM of 0.62. After investigating the most difficult images, I enhanced the brightness, sharpness, color, and contrast of the 
inputs. Model 5 now has SSIM of 0.63.    

Definitely have no idea how to improve further...
