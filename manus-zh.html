<h3>Full version for those who are willing to bear with my ramblings:</h3>
<p>Manus, the so-called general AI agent, was launched for beta testing by the Monica AI team on 5 March 2025, which generated a lot of excitement for getting the invitation code. The price of the code in the secondary market once reached a crazy figure, RMB 100,000 (approx. USD 1,382). Key feature of Manus is its ability to directly execute an answer to user’s question (or “prompt”) and deliver a sensible output. Currently, most AI products are Chatbots, limited to giving answers only. They can be considered as more intelligent version of the stupid Chatbot we had before that never gets your question. <strong>The significance of Manus is that it marks the beginning of a new generation of AI products that can directly turn thoughts into actions.</strong> Let’s call this generation of AI <strong>“Executable AI”</strong> for now.   </p>
<p>As a Microsoft Co-pilot user, the pain points I have are always “Why cannot Co-pilot directly write its answers to a Word file?” or “Why cannot Co-pilot directly work on the Excel sheet?” Also, as a busy, lazy and imaginative person, I always come up with tons of ideas about what tools I can build with my crappy programming skill but never have time to actually build them. Hence, Manus looks like the panacea to resolve my laziness both at work and at personal innovation.   </p>
<p>So, I just jumped in the queue of getting the invitation code with a passionate 500+-word application statement. Of course, this far exceeds the word limit of 1,024 characters so I have to cut short…a lot. But thinking about the number 1,024, which sounds so computer-science in that 1,024 character exactly equals 1 KB. We can reasonably expect Manus to use Manus for invitation code screening. In the end, what’s the point of me writing in the hope of my passion can move a “human” screener. I should have used AI like DeepSeek to move AI. </p>
<p>While I am cooling down with my fever and writing down my thoughts on Manus, I really start to question “Is Manus really that magical as it seems?”. From the demo of Manus, we can see its execution is mostly based on web scraping. It searches the internet (or uses API or local imports), collects data, analyzes and reports. And the use cases I proposed in my application (which I generously listed below being aware that my idea might be stolen by someone), out of my intention, all happens to be web scraping heavy, except for the self QC part.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Use case 1: News automation</strong>  </p>
<p>Manus can help automatically scrap regulatory notices or news from various authoritative websites, consolidate them with an AI-generated summary, and send through email as newsletters to stakeholders. </p>
<p>As the financial industry relies heavily on timely information, this tool is helpful for the compliance teams to keep abreast of the latest regulatory development as well as for research and products teams to keep track of the mega trends. Manus is expected to bring benefits like a significantly shortened coding time as well as low maintenance cost if the algorithm needs to be updated.</p>
<p><strong>Use case 2: Macroeconomic data dashboard</strong>  </p>
<p>Manus can help collect macroeconomic data points from official sources such as Central Bank websites, Stock Exchanges’ statistics reports or World Bank. It can streamline the creation of a web-based dashboard for those macroeconomic data with interactive visualizations. </p>
<p>This function is particularly helpful for the research teams within a financial institution. Same as above, Manus can significantly enhance efficiency while ensuring timely, accurate data collection.</p>
<p><strong>Use case 3: Sustainability report analysis</strong>  </p>
<p>Sustainability report is currently very qualitative compared to the tradition financial reports, i.e., more texts than data points. Also, machine readable XBRL format is still under development so the data collection for ESG ratings is currently very manual, either involving human to read and extract from reports or using questionnaires. Moreover, web scraping is required for the collection of sustainability reports. This can be especially tedious if there is no centralized repository developed by stock exchanges for access of companies’ reports.</p>
<p>Manus can help: first, streamline the report collection by automatically find and read the reports; second, streamline the textual analysis leveraging the capability of AI language model; third, directly produce analysis from the raw data collected.</p>
<p>One point of my concern in the above report reading process is whether there is an OCR function embedded in Manus. Some sustainability reports are not a standard pdf format so require OCR to identify the text. Also of my interest is the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the data collected by Manus. It should at least beat human for the application to be commercially viable.</p>
<p><strong>Use case 4: Self-facilitated quality control</strong>  </p>
<p>Within all the above use cases, Manus can also generate interim logs for human inspection. This will help with quality control and ongoing finetuning of the output. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am thinking about the algorithm behind Manus as follows:   </p>
<ol>
<li>understanding prompt and generate to-do list, </li>
<li>search relevant website, </li>
<li>scrap information from the website [in case there is a security measure like CAPTCHA, or the notorious version of CAPTCHA, GEETEST, which I gave up to deal with, Manus will ask user if it can try alternatives] / or directly extract information using API, </li>
<li>synthesize the information collected, </li>
<li>write into a markdown file or website for final delivery.     </li>
</ol>
<p>So it is that simple. </p>
<p>When I went on to think about the potential of integrating Manus into Microsoft office to help solve my pain points, I suddenly thought of another big problem, which is “Why not Microsoft make Co-pilot executable?” Given that Co-pilot already gives very good answers, it seems that they just need to give permission to Co-pilot to write on the macro of Microsoft program and execute it. Then I am thinking about if Co-pilot is really authorized to execute its answer, does it mean Co-pilot will control the Microsoft app? What would be the level of security risk to let an AI control your Office suite and get the permission to use whatever work-related content you have? <strong>The security and operational risks are too high to bear a quick launch of executable AI in a work context such as the Microsoft system, which also explains why Manus is largely web scraping based.</strong>   </p>
<p>Part of why Manus appears so destructive is the wise choice of the team to open up the “black box” by making the execution process of Manus transparent. We always have a degree of fear or amazement when looking at a machine automatically doing things. By flashing the codes generated by Manus and the websites it browses through a “Manus’s computer” window, people feel concrete that the AI is actually processing their command. It feels super good when you do not have to do things yourself but can freeride a reasonable deliverable without being blamed. <strong>“Manus’s computer” window really helps the marketing of Manus, targeting directly at our curiosity about the “black box” feature of AI and our nature to be lazy.</strong>    </p>
<p><strong>Going forward, the success of Manus, or any executable AI, will depend on the use cases.</strong> The value of the action conducted by Manus is largely driven by the practical value of the question asked by the end user, and whether the end user assumes the responsibility to examine and finetune the output. When deployed appropriately, the end user can turn the general AI agent into a specialized AI that can tackle sector-specific problems, such as the above Use case 3 in the context of sustainable finance. To this end, <strong>Manus or any upcoming executable AI will set a higher bar for us to be AI-ready and more professional, i.e., knowing what you are doing and then partnering with AI.</strong> As with all AI applications, the credibility of the output as well as the final liability will be upon the human users, <strong>“AI can only be as good as you.”</strong> However, we should be cautious that since our understanding of AI is still fuzzy now, people can easily fake their expertise using AI.   </p>
